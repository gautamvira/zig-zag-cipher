# zig-zag-cipher
The encryption function creates a 2-D array with dimensions – rows = key, columns = length of plaintext. The plaintext is then inserted into the array in a zig-zag pattern by incrementing the column index by one after each character and incrementing or decrementing the row index depending on whether the pattern is moving upward or downward – a Boolean variable is used to keep track of this movement.  
The function to print the ciphertext simply prints the 2-D array – created by the encryption function – row-wise.  
The decryption function creates a 2-D array with dimensions – rows = key, columns = length of ciphertext. In the array, elements in a zig-zag pattern are replaced with \'\`' to marks the indices where the characters of the ciphertext belong. The ciphertext is then inserted into the array character by character and row-wise replacing the '\`'.  
The function to print the plaintext prints the 2-D array – created by the decryption function – in a zig-zag pattern like how the plaintext is inserted by the encryption function into the array.
